This repository is the jumping-off point for general demos of my work.

A lot of what I've done pre-dates gitHub and still lives on mousetech.com source
repositories, so there's not much here yet. Look at http://svn.mousetech.com/svn as
a primary archive for published open-source and sample work by me.

In this gitHub repo, I've uploaded the Functional Specification document
for the "jtaonthemove" demo application. A full set of documents for a production
project would include the Executive Summary, Implementation Specification, and User
and Administrator documents. When time permits.

The running version of the transit application is operating out of a Docker container
on http://www.mousetech.com/jta/ and the recommended way to see the actual app UI is
to visit the "administrative main page", which is linked from the welcome page.

Source code for the latest version is at
